                    <span class="character-font">King Khufu</span> flourished 25th century BCE) 
                    second king of the 4th dynasty (c. 2543â€“c. 2436 BCE) of Egypt and builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza, 
                    the largest single building to that time. It and two nearby pyramids are collectively known as the Pyramids of Giza.
                    Khufuâ€™s reign and that of his son Khafre were represented by the Greek historian Herodotus as 106 years of oppression and misery, 
                    but this was belied by Khufuâ€™s posthumous reputation in Egypt as a wise ruler. 
                    Herodotusâ€™s story of Khufuâ€™s prostitution of his daughter in order to raise money for his building projects is clearly apocryphal.<br>
                    Although few written sources remain, 
                    it is known that Khufu was the son and successor of King Snefru and his queen Hetepheres and was probably married four times: 
                    to Merityetes, who was buried in one of the three small pyramids beside his own; to a second queen, whose name is unknown; 
                    to Henutsen, whose small pyramid is the third of the group; and to Nefert-kau, the eldest of Snefruâ€™s daughters. 
                    Two of his sons, Redjedef and Khafre, succeeded him in turn.
